    <section class="main-content">
    <p>The following story is one of the most often told in the Data Science community: Some time ago the military built a system which aim it was to distinguish military vehicles from civilian ones. They chose a neural network approach and trained the system with pictures of tanks, humvees and misile launchers on the one hand and normal cars, pickups and trucks on the other. And after having reached a satisfactory accuracy they brought the system into the field (quite literary). It failed completely, performing no better than a coin toss. What had happened? No one knew, so they re-engineered the black box (no small feat in itself) and found that most of the military pics where taken at dusk or dawn and most civilian pics under brighter weather conditions. The neural net had learned the difference between light and dark!
Although this might be an urban legend the fact that it is so often told wants to tell us something:
<ol><li>Many of our Machine Learning models are so complex that we cannot understand them ourselves.</li>
<li>Because of 1. we cannot differentiate between the simpler aspects of a problem which can be tackled by simple models and the more sophisticated ones which need specilized treatment.</li></ol>
The above is not only true for neural networks (and especially deep neural networks) but for most of the methods used today, especially Support Vector Machines and Random Forrests and in general all kinds of ensemble based methods.
In one word: We need a good baseline which builds “the best simple model” that strikes a balance between the best accuracy possible with a model that is still simple to grasp: We have developed the OneR package for finding this sweet spot and thereby establishing a new baseline for classification models in Machine Learning.

Rules:
