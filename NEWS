OneR 1.4 (2016-07-25)
=====================

NEW FEATURES
- Added a vignette.
- breastcancer: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Original Data Set now included in the package.
- OneR, optbin, maxlevels: Consistent handling of unused factor levels (e.g. due to subsetting) was added. These are dropped for analysis and a warning is given.

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS
- bin & optbin: In case of removing instances due to missing values the resulting warning gives the number of removed instances.
- Some minor streamlining of code.


OneR 1.3 (2016-07-22)
=====================

NEW FEATURES
- bin: New method "clusters", which determines the bins according to automatically determined clusters in the data.
- OneR: A new element "call" with the specified arguments of the actual function call was added to the internal class structure of OneR objects.
- print & summary: The function call with the specified arguments which was used to build the model is printed first.

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS
- bin & optbin: In cases where there were missing values and already a factor level "NA" the functions gave an unhelpful warning.
- eval_model: Added warning when actual contains missing values.
- eval_model: Added "Confusion matrix" to printout for clarity.
- Extension of and minor corrections in documentation
- Some minor streamlining of code.

BUGFIXES
- predict: The combination of intervals and "NA"s caused an error.
- bin: The method "content" stopped with an error in case of missing values.
- optbin: The method "logreg" stopped in some borderline cases with missing values with an error.
- optbin: Some borderline cases could result in a "breaks are not unique" error.
- OneR: In some borderline cases with very large datasets the numbering of printed ranks (verbose = TRUE) could be wrong due to rounding errors.
