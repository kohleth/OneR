OneR 1.3 (2016-07-14)
=====================

NEW FEATURES
- bin: New method "clusters", which determines the bins according to automatically determined clusters in the data.
- OneR: A new element "call" with the specified arguments of the actual function call was added to the internal class structure of OneR objects.
- print & summary: The function call with the specified arguments which was used to build the model is printed first.

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS
- bin & optbin: In cases where there were missing values and already a factor level "NA" the functions gave an unhelpful warning.
- eval_model: Added "Confusion matrix" to printout for clarity.
- Extension of and minor corrections in documentation

BUGFIXES
- bin: The method "content" stopped with an error in case of missing values.
- optbin: The method "logreg" stopped in some borderline cases with missing values with an error.
- optbin: Some borderline cases could result in a "breaks are not unique" error.
- OneR: In some borderline cases with very large datasets the numbering of printed ranks (verbose = TRUE) could be wrong due to rounding errors.
