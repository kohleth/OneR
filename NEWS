OneR 2.0.1 (2016-XX-XX)
=====================

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS
- some minor corrections in documentation.

OneR 2.0 (2016-08-12)
=====================

NEW FEATURES
- Added a vignette.
- breastcancer: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Original Data Set now included in the package.
- predict: New type "prob" which gives a matrix whose columns are the probability of the first, second, etc. class.
- optbin: New method "infogain" (information gain) which is an entropy based method to determine the cutpoints which make the resulting bins as pure as possible.
- OneR, optbin, maxlevels: Consistent handling of unused factor levels (e.g. due to subsetting) was added. These are dropped for analysis and a warning is given.

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS
- bin & optbin: In case of removing instances due to missing values the resulting warning gives the number of removed instances.
- maxlevels: With data containing missing values an unhelpful warning was given.
- predict: Numerical values that are smaller or bigger than model limits are now transformed into (-Inf, min] or (max, Inf] respectively.
- predict: output of type "class" is a factor now.
- Some streamlining and consolidation of code for better maintenance.

BUGFIXES
- bin & optbin: In some borderline cases when the function addNA was used in preprocessing print.OneR stopped with an error.


OneR 1.3 (2016-07-22)
=====================

NEW FEATURES
- bin: New method "clusters", which determines the bins according to automatically determined clusters in the data.
- OneR: A new element "call" with the specified arguments of the actual function call was added to the internal class structure of OneR objects.
- print & summary: The function call with the specified arguments which was used to build the model is printed first.

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS
- bin & optbin: In cases where there were missing values and already a factor level "NA" the functions gave an unhelpful warning.
- eval_model: Added warning when actual contains missing values.
- eval_model: Added "Confusion matrix" to printout for clarity.
- Extension of and minor corrections in documentation
- Some minor streamlining of code.

BUGFIXES
- predict: The combination of intervals and "NA"s caused an error.
- bin: The method "content" stopped with an error in case of missing values.
- optbin: The method "logreg" stopped in some borderline cases with missing values with an error.
- optbin: Some borderline cases could result in a "breaks are not unique" error.
- OneR: In some borderline cases with very large datasets the numbering of printed ranks (verbose = TRUE) could be wrong due to rounding errors.


OneR 1.2 (2016-06-20)
=====================

Initial release on CRAN
